# E07a-Particles

The element I chose to simulate was fire. To try to replicate a simular effect, I edited the colors to more red/orange tones. Then, I slightly increased the sizes of the particles, to try to make the fire effect more realistic. Finally I chose one of the flame images to best represent a fire.
